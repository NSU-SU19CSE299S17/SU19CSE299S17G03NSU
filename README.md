Project Proposals:

 

Main Idea - Catalogue of Educational Materials (catchier name pending) - Takes inspiration from websites such as IMDB, Goodreads or PCPartPicker and lets you compile your own list of Educational Material such as books, videos, online courses and websites, etc. For example, for a list of "Beginner Web Dev" materials, it could list a few books on HTML and CSS, a few different videos to show how to set up a back end, then an online course on backend programming. Each list is saved individually and can be used for personal reference or shared with others.
